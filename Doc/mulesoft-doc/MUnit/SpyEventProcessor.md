## Spy Event Processor

<hr>


### 1. What is Spy Event Processor

> The Spy Processor enables you to spy on what happens before and after an event processor is called.

This enables you to validate, for example that a selected Mule Event reaches a specific event processor containing a specific payload or variable.

Setting a spy processor tells MUnit to run a set of instructions (usually assertions or verifications) before and/or after the execution of the spied event processor.
